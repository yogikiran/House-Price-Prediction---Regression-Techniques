# House-Price-Prediction---Regression-Techniques
The project aims to predict the price of the house using some of the regression techniques, both linear models and advanced models. The Data mining methods that are covered include: Linear models Classical Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net. Advanced models - XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Regressor, LightGBM and CatBoost. Ensemble model Stacking models - Linear Mixture, Advanced Mixture and Mixture of Linear and Advanced Mixture. The models make use of multivariable features, Feature Engineering data to enhance the quality of prediction. The evaluation is carried out using root mean square error to find the bias/variances and model scores to predict accuracy of train and test data.
